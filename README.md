# Software Engineering

Included in this repository is a sample of some of the work I have from CS340 including delta.py, a debugging algorithm built to spec for Project 4.
While this does not encompass the entirety of Project 4 it is a large part. 

Additionally, there is a shell script, 'run-tests.sh' which was used to solve Project 1, which is an automated testing script.
